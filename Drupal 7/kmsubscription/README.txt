-- KM Subscription --

The Knowledge Marketing Subscription Manager is a set of tools
specifically made to allow communication between the website and the
ECN.  The ECN is intended to manage and maintain all groups (email
lists), folders and general subscriber information per group.

Notes:
1. This module will install a block and create a page for you to use
to capture subscriber information
2. The Overlay plugin requires this module
3. The subscription page and block both require you to have at least
1 group selected (which can be selected from this page: /admin/config/services/knowledge-marketing/management)
4. You can provide custom aliases per group, and also see the group
subscription count in the ECN vs. the website.
5. By default, only the email address field is added upon
installation.  Other fields are available, and the option to use additional UDF (user defined fields) is also available.  If you
decide to create a UDF, please make sure it is created in the group (in the ECN) first.  Making the field in the website will not tie it
to the group in the ECN.
6. Both the page and block allow you to reorganize your lists and
fields (incase you want to show a specific ordering of fields). For example:  First Name, Last Name (or vice versa).
